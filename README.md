## API

Use this as the basis for your own API documentation. Add a new third-level
heading for your custom entities, and follow the pattern provided for the
built-in user authentication documentation.

Scripts are included in [`curl-scripts`](curl-scripts) to test built-in actions. Feel free to use Postman for testing, using the curl scripts listed below and in the folder for setting up headers and request bodies.
Add your own scripts to test your custom API.
